# Basic Algorithms in Java

Here is a list of the absolute, must-have knowledge:


## 1. ArrayList
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. 
Because they're stored together, we are able to access a random element in constant time. 


## 2. LinkedList
Linked list is a linear data structure which link all the separated elements together by the **reference field**.
It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index, where N is the length of the linked list.


## 3. Queue & Stack

### Queue and BFS

### Stack and DFS


## 4. Tree & Graph

### Traverse a Tree
1.  Pre-order traversal is to visit the root first. Then traverse the left subtree. Finally, traverse the right subtree.
2.  In-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then visit the root. Finally, traverse the right subtree.
3.  Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
4.  Level-order traversal is to traverse the tree level by level. (Typically, we use a queue to help us to do BFS.)


## 5. Recursion & Dynamic Programming

### Principle of Recursion
1.  A base case: a terminating scenario that does not use recursion to produce an answer.
2.  A recurrence relation: reduces all other cases towards the base case.


## 6. Sorting & Searching
