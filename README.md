Practicing implementing the data structures and algorithm is a great exercise.

Here is a list of the absolute, must-have knowledge:
## 1. ArrayList
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. 
Because they're stored together, we are able to access a random element in constant time. 
## 2. LinkedList
Linked list is a linear data structure which link all the separated elements together by the **reference field**.
It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index, where N is the length of the linked list.
